# Kiwi and Blocks

While Prolific is no stranger to testing frameworks, one of our recent iOS projects has familiarized us with a new one: [Kiwi](https://github.com/kiwi-bdd/Kiwi). Kiwi is described as a "Behavior Driven Development (BDD) library for iOS development" - meaning it allows developers to write "specs" in code about expected behavior. The purpose of defining behavior is to catch when it unintentionally changes during refactors or implementation of new features.

Kiwi exists in an ecosystem of iOS [testing](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/DeveloperTools/Conceptual/testing_with_xcode/Introduction/Introduction.html) [frameworks](https://github.com/specta/specta) [gaining](https://github.com/kif-framework/KIF) [popularity](https://github.com/calabash/calabash-ios) [among](https://github.com/facebook/ios-snapshot-test-case) [developers](https://github.com/Quick/Quick). There are plenty of great pieces out there exploring the pros and cons of each - and there is no one definitive call on which should be used. However, what is becoming more definitive is that iOS applications are not exempt from the general notion that testing frameworks have a place in the process of developing quality software. If you're exploring or using tests in your iOS development and Kiwi is your testing framework of choice, read on as I explore one of its lesser documented features: the ability to stub the behavior of methods that execute blocks.
